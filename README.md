## Inspiration

We did a research about the issues that pilgrims face during hajj and we also heard some stories from previous pilgrims about the difficulties that they faced during hajj we found out that communication is one of the biggest issues so, we decided to encounter this issue and find a suitable solution for it. 

## What it does

An application that will notify the pilgrims of important events such as traffic, lost items, weather updates, transportation, campaigns, general information. It will be like a instant broadcast service that will help pilgrims throughout their stay during hajj. 

## Elevator pitch
Communication at the right time to the right people

## How we built it
We are building the application with Android studio and we used App42 Cloud API for geo based push notifications

## Challenges we ran into
We still are facing a challenge of making the geo based push notifications work 100%

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to find a solution that encapsulates one of the most common problems that the pilgrims face and we took into account making the solution easy to use.
- We were able to design the entire application UI/UX and build a prototype that explains our idea from A to Z.
- We were able to find a suitable solution for geo based push notifications

## What we learned
- How to find the simple solution for a complicated problem, we spent almost 2 days on simplifying our idea and finding the best solution for the given problem which in our case was "Communication in hajj".
- We also learned how to find the best practices to do certain things such as searching for suitable APIs that help in our product's pitch
- How to make the right decision in a short time 
- Finalizing the tasks within the given time frame 

## What's next for NotifyHajj
- Integration with databases from different ministries
- Implementing all the functions which are related to communication
- Allowing admins from different categories to communicate with each other
- Fixing our geo based push notifications and making them sent based on a recommender system using AI
